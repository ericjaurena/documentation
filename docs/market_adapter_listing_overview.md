Adapters can be added to the Market in two different ways. 

- If you built the adapter yourself, and it's in a GitHub repo that you own, follow the [docs](https://docs.linkpool.io/docs/market_adapter_listing_owner) to configure and import the adapter directly from your repo.

- If you've found an existing adapter, but it's in a repo that you down own, the [docs](https://docs.linkpool.io/docs/market_adapter_listing_open_adapter) detail how to fill out a simple form to import the adapter.
